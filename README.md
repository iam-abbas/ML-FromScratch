A community-built repository which has Machine Learning algorithms that are built using basics (from scratch) in various languages .

</p>

## About
Python implementations of some of the fundamental Machine Learning models and algorithms from scratch.

The purpose of this project is not to produce as optimized and computationally efficient algorithms as possible
but rather to present the inner workings of them in a transparent and accessible way.
