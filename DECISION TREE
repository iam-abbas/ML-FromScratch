#decision tree is one of the important ML algorithm . It is used for both classification and regression also .
#to use decision tree algorithm and testing it . Use the steps given below and try to understand each step using the comments .

#Suppose you are given data and you have divided it into X_train,X_test(feature columns) and y_train , y_test(target columns) Then you can test your model by following commands 
# importing DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree
 
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier  
classifier  = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='gini')  

#Training the classifier with X_train and y_train

classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

#predicting the values of y with respect to X_test 

y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test) 

#importing classification report and determining confusion matrix for predicted and observed y_test values

from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix  
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))  
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

#importing accuracy_score function from sklearn.metrics package

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_
 acc = accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred)
print("Accuracy for this model {} %".format(acc*100))
